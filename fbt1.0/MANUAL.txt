Introduction 

%%Give some introduction to FBT here%%

NOTES: 

1. In this version of FBT, code and data should be in the same 
   directory. The parameters $instdir and $datadir in gram_init.pm
   are not guaranteed to work! You have been warned! :-) 

2. .dot files for the NTP carcinogens data set is included in this 
   distribution. 

Input data formats 

%%Give an introduction to dotty format and the URL for graphviz%% 

Mining .dot files 

%%Expand the following points%%

1. Set relevant parameters in gram_init.pm 
2. Run fbt.pl 
3. Results will be stored in clustersXX.st where XX is the iteration number
   of the last iteration. 
4. Each line in the above file will be isomorphic subgraphs (iff newfbt
   runs to its logical conclusion) 
5. For any given .itm file (say xyz.itm) listed in a cluster convert it to 
   .dot file using itm2dot.pl (./itm2dot.pl xyz.itm > xyz.dot) 
6. View the substructures using dotty (available from the Graphviz suite) 
   or neato (also available from Graphviz) tools 
7. Other outputs from the run: 
	time.$$: Time in seconds taken for each iteration 
	ctime.$$: Cumulative running time at the end of each iteration 
	substructures.$$: No. of substructures at each iteration 
	numpaths.dat.$$: No. of walks processed in each iteration 
	data.$$: Other relevant data for this run 

In the above, $$ is the process-id of the fbt process. 

Relevant Parameters in gram_init.pm: 

$ms: minimum filtration threshold 


Mining PDB records 

%%Expand the following steps: 
1. Preprocess PDB files into .dot files using preprocessors 
2. Mine .dot files using the steps outlined above 
3. From the resulting .itm files, extract the relevant part of the protein
   structure 
4. View these extracted structures using RasMol or any other protein 
   rendering tool 

Preprocessing PDB files into .dot files 

bb-preprocess.pl <PDBfile> 

Returns a .dot file where each atom on the backbone is connected to all 
other atoms on the backbone that lie within a distance of $radius angstroms. 
$radius can be changed in proximity.pl 

amino-preprocess.pl <PDBFILE> 

Returns a .dot file where node labels are amino acid labels rather than 
atom symbols. Results in an amino-acid proximity graph of the protein 
molecule 


Extracting lines from PDB file based on .itm files

Using the following tools, you can extract only that part of a protein 
structure that has been returned by a .itm file (an interesting substructure).

extract.pl <itm_file> <PDB_file> 0 

Will extract the relevant ATOM lines from a given PDB file based on the contents
of the .itm file. The results will be displayed on stdout; it can be 
redirected to a file. The 0 in the fourth parameter is a dummy. It is required
only for backward compatibility of a previous version of the .itm file format. 


aminoextract.pl <itm_file> <PDB_file> 0 

Will extract the entire amino acid for each backbone atom found in the .itm
file. The 0 in the fourth parameter is again a required dummy.
